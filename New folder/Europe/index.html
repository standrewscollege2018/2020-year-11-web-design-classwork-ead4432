          <p>I was lucky enough to visit Europe last year and wanted to share some of my experiences and photos <br>

            <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
            <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!<br>

              We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>

            <h2>Italy</h2>
            <p>We loved Italy! From the ancient ruins to the beautiful scenery and delicious food, we still have many wonderful memories.</p>

            <h2>Greece</h2>
            <p>Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals.<br>

            We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.</p>

            <h2>France</h2>
            <p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.<br>

            Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.<br>

            We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
